Fraud Transaction Detection - Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a Machine Learning project that focuses on fraud transaction detection using Logistic Regression. The code utilizes the popular libraries numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Project Description
The objective of this project is to build a model to detect fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data. We use Logistic Regression as the classification algorithm due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy (imported as np)
pandas (imported as pd)
scikit-learn
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Run the fraud_detection.py script to see the model in action.
Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different approaches.
Data
The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository. Make sure to place the data file (CSV or any supported format) in the data directory before running the script. The dataset should contain relevant features and a target variable for fraud labels.

Usage
Import necessary libraries:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
Load and preprocess the data:

python
Copy code
# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("data/fraud_data.csv")

# Data preprocessing steps...
Split the data into training and testing sets:

python
Copy code
# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop("fraud_label", axis=1)
y = data["fraud_label"]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Create and train the Logistic Regression model:

python
Copy code
# Create the model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Make predictions and evaluate the model:

python
Copy code
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
